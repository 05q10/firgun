      "content": "I woke up, slowly trying to focus on the naked bulb above me. In my nebulous surroundings, I saw a party of people in a uniform of white shirts and black stripes tied with chains; in my futile efforts to pick myself up, I fell back onto the pool of saliva that had dripped through the night! I realized that I was lying face-down on my stomach, breathing in the rancid residue that coated the floor; it smelled like death. The prison cell was a hollow cube on concrete, one way in with no windows, thus I had no idea how much time had passed or if it was night or day! Disorientating by design, the cell held me captive between a group of criminals that seemed like predators ready to pounce on any new prey in the cell!\n\nAs I came to consciousness, I figured out a well-built man sitting right opposite me, staring right into my eyes! The way his eyes squinted when he glared at me reminded me of a pit viper's slit-like pupils; they spoke of indignance and fury boiling in his body like lightning on a pitch-black night. Even though I didn't know him, I guessed that he was wrathful and filled with exasperation due to the torture in the prison. His voice was harsh and had a guttural British accent that ached my eardrums!\n\nHe went on to initiate small talk with another prisoner who was sitting with arrogance and gave off a vibe of haughtiness. Stolidity ran through his blood and he was completely devoid of pain caused by the friction between the rusting chain and his wrinkled skin! Thin wisps of hair straggled up his sunken cheeks like etiolated vines desperately seeking daylight, skimpy-looking beard. Looked like he was an old inhabitant of the place; this hell was his home.\n\nHere I had no rights. I could not leave. I could not refuse the poisons that were served in dented metal plates that made my mind slow to the point of stopping to cease every emotion. Bed is a mattress on the cold floor with a single blanket for warmth. There is no rest from the screams of others, the ones driven crazier by the hours of persecution. We no longer belonged to the community of humans; we had descended to a level where we were treated like animals. Crazy is crazy and the constables were the worst for carrying that stigma.\n\nTwo men fought in the grimy corners of the cell for the last cup of foul-smelling and tasteless boiled water! One of them had a tongue soaked in the taste of blood and the other revealed an articulate blade, sleekly placed in the middle of his mouth! A fist was brought violently at the little man’s face and his nose snapped into grotesquery. This was normal in a place like this, a place so cold and so relentless.\n\nIn the midst of this fight, I glanced at a young lad with unimpeachable onyx-black empty eyes sunken in a sea of tears. He cried as if his brain was being shredded from the inside; emotional pain flowed out of his every pore. From his mouth came a cry so raw that even the eyes of the strangers around us were suddenly wet with tears. His nails were filled with dust and mire with specks of blood, probably he tried to scrape the concrete walls beside him! When he looked at me, I could see through his pure soul that was caged between the iron bars of this cell.\n\nLooking at a new guest enter with clinking handcuffs, revolting between the constables was dragged towards our room, he growled like a beast—shattering me!\n\nIn this room full of people, I was alone, very alone. Unaware of their names or personalities, I could only make assumptions. However, in the pursuit of discovering them, I would lose myself!\n\nImprisonment leaves you with yourself. All alone with insects for company, and that's when the other part of you starts to speak, blathering, arguing with thoughts, screaming for attention. And that's when prison breaks you, leaving you to break yourself. Until there is no more you, but a shell, a hollow, reverberate one, without life."

      "content": "I set my foot into the Uffizi Gallery and found myself encompassed by a plethora of gigantic painted canvases; some were vibrantly colored, some were monochromatic, and others looked too powerful. Being a Libran, I yearned for a dynamic painting that balanced calm and warm colors while still making a significant impact. Perambulating under the lofty corridor in pursuit of my perfect painting, my legs stopped in front of an enormous canvas…\n\n'The Birth of Venus,' the painting was labeled—an avant-garde masterpiece by the famous Alessandro Botticelli. An intricately composed scene unfolded before my eyes, and I was simply stumped. Venus, often remembered as the Greek Goddess Aphrodite, stood right in front of me. From an agreeable distance, the painting depicted Venus floating on the sea on a large scallop shell, drifting towards the shore by the breath of two wind gods and accompanied by a nymph who waited on the sand to drape Venus in a flower-satiated coral pink mantle.\n\nAs I moved closer to comprehend the painting, I was intimidated by Venus’s greatly emphasized presence. The figure of Aphrodite, posing demurely yet elegantly by covering her breasts, with her weight shifted to her left leg, was alluring. Her body followed the structure of Gothic ivory. Surrounded by sinuous rhythms of cascading drapery and wavy bronze hair, the picture was filled with serene movement that constantly led the eye to make new connections. As the sacred deity symbolizing love, the painting’s background also personified her as the harbinger of spring.\n\nDelving deeper, I observed that the color palette comprised five main colors: blue, orange, red, green, and white, which were beautifully balanced across the scene. These colors were intense yet gave an earthly feel. Keeping Venus at the center, Botticelli also provided an aqueous effect by using soft colors and lines, creating a three-dimensional aesthetic. The circular, tender light suggested unified movement, allowing me to experience the soothing rhythm of the sky and sea.\n\nGentle strokes created a flowy effect in the cherubs and clouds, contrasting with the heavy contouring of the shell upon which the muse stood. Shifting my attention to the background, the abrupt and stagnant sea figures forced me to focus once again on Venus—the magic of the masterpiece!\n\nTaking a step back and examining the painting from a distance again, I realized the fine skill of Botticelli. The phantasmagoric effect of Venus floating towards me left me no choice but to admire her.\n\nCapturing the masterpiece in my head, I headed back, thinking about how the artist had conveyed the message of a higher realm of love, manifested in human form."
